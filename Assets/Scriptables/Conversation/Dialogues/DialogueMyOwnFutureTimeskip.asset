  - Dialogue: 'Your lives settle into a new rhythm. You help Elara around the tower,
      tending to the garden, assisting with her experiments, even learning some basic
      spells. You are a quick learner, and Elara seems to be enjoying your company,
      your curiosity. '

  - Dialogue: You are still strangers, in many ways, but, in a way, you are also
      becoming familiar. Elara is weaving herself into the fabric of your new life,
      creating new memories, forging a new connection.

  - Dialogue: But the past still lingers, a constant shadow between you. You still
      have flashes of memories of Clara, moments that would trigger you, leaving
      you distant and withdrawn.

  - Dialogue: "And Elara, despite her best efforts, can\u2019t entirely shake the
      resentment, the bitterness of knowing that she had brought you back, only to
      share you with the ghost of another woman."
