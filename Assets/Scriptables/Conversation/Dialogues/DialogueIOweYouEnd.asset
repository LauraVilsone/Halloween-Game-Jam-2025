  - Dialogue: "But, please, listen. The spell I used to bring you back\u2026 something
      went wrong. It drained a part of my life force, leaving me weakened, vulnerable
      and gave false memories to you."

  - Dialogue: I need to replenish that life force, bring you back again with your
      true memories, and the only way to do that is through a sacrifice.

  - Dialogue: I don't want to kill you, Liam. But if you were to die willingly, offering
      your life force to me, it would complete the spell, it would heal me, and it
      would finally sever the connection to Clara. You would be truly mine, and I
      would be truly yours.

  - Dialogue: "You are silent, mind reeling from her request. You had been prepared
      to offer her anything, but this\u2026 this was beyond anything you could have
      imagined."

  - Dialogue: To die, again, for a woman who claimed to love you, but who had also
      resurrected you against his will, only to trap you in a life that was not entirely
      your own.
