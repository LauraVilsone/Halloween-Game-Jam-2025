  - Dialogue: "You spend the next few days contemplating Elara\u2019s impossible
      request, weighing the morality of it all, the implications for your own existence.
      Is it worth sacrificing your newfound life, however fractured, for a woman
      who was both your savior and your captor?"

  - Dialogue: You speak with Elara rarely during this time, needing the space to
      come to a decision. You watch her from afar, observing her dedication to her
      craft, her quiet strength, her undeniable loneliness. You see the flicker of
      hope that had rekindled in her eyes since you had agreed to consider her request.
